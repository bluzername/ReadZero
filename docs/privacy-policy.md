## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
- Save and organize your reading list
- Extract article content for offline reading
- Generate AI-powered summaries and daily digests
- Generate AI-powered audio podcast episodes from your daily digests
- Improve app functionality and user experience

## AI Processing

ReadZero uses artificial intelligence to:
- Summarize articles you save
- Generate daily digest newsletters
- Extract key points and themes from your reading
- Generate audio podcast episodes narrating your daily digests

**Important**: Your saved content is processed by third-party AI services (Anthropic Claude) to generate summaries. This processing is done securely and content is not used to train AI models.

## Audio and Podcast Generation

ReadZero generates personalized audio podcast episodes from your daily digests:
- **Text-to-Speech**: Digest summaries are converted to audio using ElevenLabs, a third-party text-to-speech service. The text of your digest is sent to ElevenLabs for audio generation.
- **Audio Storage**: Generated audio files are stored securely in Supabase Storage and are accessible only to you.
- **RSS Feed**: A personal podcast RSS feed is generated for your account, allowing you to subscribe in any podcast app. This feed URL is unique to your account.
- ElevenLabs processes only the text of your AI-generated digest summaries, not your original saved articles.

## Fallback Images

When an article does not have a featured image, ReadZero may fetch a relevant image from **Unsplash**, a third-party stock photo service, based on the article's topic. No personal data is shared with Unsplash during this process.

## Data Storage and Security

- Your data is stored securely on Supabase (cloud infrastructure)
- Data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Audio podcast files are stored in Supabase Storage with encryption
- We implement industry-standard security measures
- Your data is associated with an anonymous user ID, not personal identifiers

## Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:
- **Supabase**: Database, authentication, and file storage
- **OpenRouter/Anthropic**: AI-powered content analysis and summarization
- **Jina AI**: Article content extraction
- **xAI (Grok)**: X/Twitter post extraction
- **ElevenLabs**: Text-to-speech audio generation for podcast episodes
- **Unsplash**: Fallback images for articles without featured images

These services have their own privacy policies and data practices.

## Data Retention
