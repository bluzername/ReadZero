## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I save articles?
Share any web page to ReadZero using the iOS Share Sheet. Tap the Share button in Safari or any app, then select ReadZero. The article will be saved to your library and analyzed automatically.

### How does the Daily Digest work?
ReadZero generates a daily summary of your saved articles using AI. You can find your digest in the Daily Digest tab. If you have push notifications enabled, you'll be notified when a new digest is ready.

### How do I listen to podcasts?
ReadZero can generate audio versions of your daily digests. When a podcast episode is available, you'll see a play button on the digest. You can also subscribe to your personal RSS feed in any podcast app — find the feed URL in Settings.

### Why can't I see my articles?
Make sure you have an internet connection. Your articles are synced to the cloud and require a connection to load. If articles still don't appear, try closing and reopening the app.

### How do I export my data?
Go to Settings > Export Data to download all your articles and digests as a JSON file.

### How do I delete my data?
Go to Settings > Clear All Data to permanently delete all your saved articles and digests.
